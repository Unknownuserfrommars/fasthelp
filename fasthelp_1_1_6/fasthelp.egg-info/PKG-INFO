## Changelog (Since 1.0.12)

### (For Changelogs from 1.0.12-1.0.30, see ancient releases. Have to make space for newer versions)

- 1.1.6: Better integration with my other project: PackageImporter. (By "better integration" i mean "grabbed all the source code from it and thus not needing you to install another 7.36MB package"). Accompanied by very minor bug fixes and some code tweaks.
- 1.1.3: Bug fix and class enhancements
- 1.1.0.1: Major bug fix on the `ModuleNotFoundError` while importing
- 1.1.0: Major release. Added some functions, fixed `exec()` logic, added `@staticmethod` decorator to some of the functions. Added an additional file for detecting GPU info. Renamed some function/class names.

## Version

FastHelp 1.1.6

## In-Development Versions:

- 1.1.7
- 1.2.0 (Yes, we're starting it early because there is some major features (other than cli) we plan in this release.)

## NEWS:

- Sorry for the big delay of no Updates.

## Roadmap

- In 1.2.x versions: Command Line Interface (CLI). And a new, exciting feature (TOPSecret!).
- In 1.3.x versions: Use subpackages and probably implement some of the tasks in the `Future` class.
