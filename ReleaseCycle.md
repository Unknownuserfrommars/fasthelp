This markdown main talks aboput the future release cycles of Fasthelp.
1. Patch releases: Patch releases only happens when there is a major bug (eg: Import Error) to the a.b.c version. In that case, we'll delete the original version and send a a.b.c.d version instead
2. Macro releases: Planned Weeked public macro releases. Some (or no) macro releases for insiders will be released in the week.
3. Minor releases: This means a huge leap forward. It either means changing 15%~30% of the source code, or there is more than 100 lines of code added.
4. Major releases: Not planned. Major releases mean that the older versions will be COMPLETELY UNCOMPATIBLE with the newer versions. If there really is another major version in the future, we plan to go for parallel dev for 2 months or so.

Another thing: The fasthelp LTS patch will be released every two or three months since this is not our development focus. We plan only a few versions to me compatible with one version of lts.
